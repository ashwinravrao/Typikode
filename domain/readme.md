## Domain Layer

The domain layer bridges the data and UI layers and serves to abstract potentially complex business 
logic necessary for transforming items surfaced in lower parts of the app. Use cases are the primary 
pattern employed in the domain layer and are meant to encapsulate single-purpose tasks that should be 
reused across multiple (instances of) ViewModels.
